> **:loudspeaker:** The Web3 Foundation _General Grants_ Program focuses on technology grants which teams wish to keep **private**, need to be **paid out in fiat** or are **larger than $30,000**.
>
> We ask teams to first consider applying via the [:arrow_right: _Open Grants_ Program](https://github.com/w3f/Open-Grants-Program), which has **faster processing times** and provides grants of up to $30,000 for initial applications and $100,000 for follow-up ones. Please consider applying via Open Grants no matter the scope of your project.

## :wave: Introduction

As part of our commitment to promoting the Web3 ecosystem, we offer comprehensive grants programs focused on funding software development and research efforts related to **Polkadot, Kusama and Substrate**. For more information about the Web3 Foundation, please visit the [About page](https://web3.foundation/about/) on our website.

**Only apply via the General Grants Program if:**

- you seek funding of $30,000+ and your work cannot be split into smaller milestones,
- you want your team/project information to remain private, or
- you can only accept fiat payments.

There is no maximum funding amount for General Grants. However, all applications must contain a detailed cost breakdown as described in the template and applications for larger sums will naturally be subjected to higher scrutiny. In particular, projects requesting **$30,000 or less** are likely to receive faster approval, whereas larger projects necessitate closer evaluation and may face longer waiting times as a consequence.

Teams can apply for grants more than once, but they need to successfully complete the previous project before receiving additional funds. Furthermore, teams shouldnâ€™t seek to cover 100% of their early-stage funding via W3F Grants alone.

**Most of the information and processes regarding the General Grants Program is the same as for Open Grants, unless outlined in this document**

## :pencil: Process  

1. **Application**

    We strongly recommend working off of the [grant application template](../applications/application_template.md), which gives an indication of what a good roadmap should look like and outlines the criteria and information we look for in an application.

    Partially public applications that limit financial information (i.e. the requested funding amount) to the application form in step `ii.` are preferred. However, teams are free to make fully public applications as well as fully private applications.

    1. **Fully or partially public** applications should be initiated with a pull request to this repository by following the process outlined in the [Open Grants Program](../README.md#process). Teams who intend to make a fully private application can skip this step.
    2. **Private applications**: Fill out the General Grants application form [:arrow_right: here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfMfjiRmDQDRk-4OhNASM6BAKii7rz_B1jWtbCPkUh6N7M2ww/viewform).

2. **Application Review**
   - The Web3 Foundation will review the application, determine if more information is required and potentially schedule a call with the team.
   - Parity Technologies may assist in the review of some applications.

3. **Decision**
   - Applicants will be notified via email of whether their proposal has been accepted or not.
   - If a proposal is successful, further communication will be required to determine specific details around timelines and payment schedules.

4. **Follow-up**
   - Once work on the project has started, the Web3 Foundation will want to have follow-up conversations to see how the project is progressing.
   - To help speed up the milestone evaluation process, take a look at the [Guidelines for Milestone Deliverables](milestone-deliverables-guidelines.md). Milestones will be evaluated based on this document and the details provided in your application.
